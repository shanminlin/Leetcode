# Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.
# 
# The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.
# 
# Example 1:<br>
# 
# Input: "abc"<br>
# Output: 3<br>
# Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".<br>
#  
# 
# Example 2:<br>
# 
# Input: "aaa"<br>
# Output: 6<br>
# Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
#
