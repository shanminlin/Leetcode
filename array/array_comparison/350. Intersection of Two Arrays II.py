# # Problem
# 
# Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
# 
# Example 1:<br>
# 
# Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]<br>
# Output: [2,2]<br>
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]<br>
# Output: [4,9]<br>
# 
# Note:
# 
# Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.<br>
# The result can be in any order.<br>
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?<br>
# What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?<br>
# What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?<br>
