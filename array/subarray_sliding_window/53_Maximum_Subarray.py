# # Problem
# 
# Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
# 
# Example:<br>
# 
# Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],<br>
# Output: 6<br>
# Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.<br>
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

# # Brainstorm
# 
# How to handle negative numbers?
# - If it is at the start or the end of the array, ignore. It will not be in the maximum subarray.
# - If it is in between, store the previous positive number, keep computing the sum, if the sum is positive, include the previous subarray, if not, restart the subarray
