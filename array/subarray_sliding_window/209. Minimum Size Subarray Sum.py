# # Problem
# 
# Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.
# 
# Example:<br>
# 
# Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]<br>
# Output: 2<br>
# Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.<br>
# 
# Follow up:<br>
# If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n). 

# # Brainstorm
# 
# Why given positive integers? compare with test cases when there are negative numbers and zeroes.
#
