# # Problem
# 
# Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.<br>
# 
# If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).<br>
# 
# The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.<br>
# 
# Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.<br>
# 
# 1,2,3 → 1,3,2<br>
# 3,2,1 → 1,2,3<br>
# 1,1,5 → 1,5,1<br>
