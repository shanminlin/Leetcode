# # Problem 
# 
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.<br>
# 
# (i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).<br>
# 
# Find the minimum element.<br>
# 
# You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.<br>
# 
# Example 1:<br>
# 
# Input: [3,4,5,1,2] <br>
# Output: 1<br>
# 
# Example 2:<br>
# 
# Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]<br>
# Output: 0
